Ban-type modes

+b <hostmask> - Ban
eg. /mode #mychannel +b [email protected]
Prevents a given hostmask from joining the channel. Hostmasks are of the form [email protected] and can contain wildcards.

Instead of using a hostmask, you can just provide a nickname or a hostname, and it will be automatically converted into a hostmask for you.
For example, setting mode +b *.some.annoying.host will be converted automatically to *!*@*.annoying.host in the ban list.

To view the list of channel bans, use mode b without a hostmask, eg. /mode #mychannel b
To remove a channel ban, use -b with the full banned hostmask, eg. /mode #mychannel -b AbusiveNick!*@*

+e <hostmask> - Ban exemption
eg. /mode #mychannel +e TrustedNick!*@*
Makes the given hostmask exempt from channel bans.
Same syntax as +b.

+I <hostmask> - Invite exemption
eg. /mode #mychannel +e RegularNick!*@*
In channels which are invite-only (see mode +i), makes the given hostmask able to join the channel without being invited first.
Same syntax as +b.

+g <filter> - Custom word filter
eg. /mode #mychannel +g badword*
Adds a bad word filter to the filter list. If the entire text of a message sent to the channel exactly matches an entry in the +g list, the message will be blocked.

You can use wildcards, but they are not implicit.
For example, setting mode +g lick* would block the words lick, licking and lickers but NOT flick, clicked or slickest.

To view the list of bad word filters, use mode g without the filter text, eg. /mode #mychannel g
To remove a filter from the list, use -b with the filter, eg. /mode #mychannel -g badword*


Permission-type modes

+v <nick> - Voice
eg. /mode #mychannel +v VoicedUser

+o <nick> - Operator
eg. /mode #mychannel +o ChanOp
Gives operator status to the specified user. As well as having all the abilities of halfops, operators can also kick users that are not admin or above, and set most channel modes.

Operators and above can give operator status.

+a <nick> - Admin
eg. /mode #mychannel +a ChannelAdmin

Flood protection modes

+f <lines:seconds> - Message flood limiter
eg. /mode #mychannel +f 5:5
Kicks any user who sends <lines> messages in <seconds> seconds to the channel. The above example would kick anyone who sends five lines of text to the channel in less than five seconds.
If you put an asterisk (*) before the parameter, flooding users will be banned instead of kicked.
eg. /mode #mychannel +f *10:5 will ban anyone who sends ten lines of text to the channel in less than five seconds.

+j <joins:seconds> - Join flood limiter
eg. /mode #mychannel +j 8:5
